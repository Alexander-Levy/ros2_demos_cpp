# Demo nodes for ROS2 written in C++

This packages is meant for learning(or posibly a cheatsheet in the future) about the core concepts in ros2. I plan to cover all of the basic funtionality in the future, but at the moment the project is in the early stages. Only a simple publisher and subcriber written for the initial commit. 

This project targets: 
 - Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
 - ROS2 Humble

## Dependencies
You basically just need ros2 humble, so `sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop` or whatever the command is these days. 

## TODO
 - [ ] write to a topic and listen to it (initial commit)
 - [ ] write a service, client 
 - [ ] create custom msg and srv
 - [ ] implement parameters
 - [ ] create a plugin
 - [ ] action servers and clients
 - [ ] composable a node
 - [ ] actually write a readme, not a to-do list
